# Lexbot Development Repository
Hello geeks!
Games have become an inevitable part of our life, and so has discord. The number of people using discord for various activities are increasing tremendously, and thus we aim to add a few functionalities in order to personalise it. How about a BOT that would play songs for you as and when you request it or even creating commands to display your favourite GIF! There are no ends to experimenting, learning and coding as you explore the realms of Discord.

This is the Development Repository for a Custom discord Bot I'm building for a server I'm currently a morderator on.
This is written in Python using discord.py Library.
